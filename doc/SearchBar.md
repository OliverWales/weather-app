# SearchBar
The SearchBar classes (`HistorySearchBar` and `CitySearchBar`) inherit from `JComboBox`.  
    
They set various settings and add appropriate strings to their drop down menus:  
* `HistorySearchBar`: previous searches, updated with new searches (stored in `history.txt`)  
* `CitySearchBar`: all cities (stored in `citylist.txt`)  
  
See `SearchBarDemo` for an example of how to use the SearchBar classes.
